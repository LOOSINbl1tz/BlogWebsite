    title: "MISCELLANEOUS 70,000",
    body: `Tonight, I hit 70,000 words on my latest manuscript. It still has a ways to go – two chapters and a conclusion, then it’s off to the publisher for edits – but, for whatever reason, this feels like a milestone worth noting. Could be the windows flung open, four bunnies and a robin playing Oonch Neech in the backyard. Could be the dusted-off Adirondack chairs, or the promise of a spring night under quilts, fireflies, Lyra. Could just be something in the air. Beginnings, I think.

      I always said I wouldn’t write another book until I was old, or at least wise. But the question kept coming – How can you walk away from the Internet when it’s your living and your life? – and the answer kept coming – How can you not? – and it occurred to me that there must be 70,000 words between those two things.
      
      Turns out there are.`,

    title: "Holding it Dear",
    body: `Ah, December.

        My daughter’s Advent book says that this month’s name is derived from the Latin word decem, meaning ten, because it was originally the tenth month of the year in the calendar of Romulus.
        
        But I’ve got another theory. Could it also be because everything – everything! – in the month of December is dialed all the way up to a ten? The joy! The meltdowns. The grief. The love and the pain and the regret. The absolute delight! The resentment. The hope! It all feels pressing, impossible to escape, pregnant with purpose and wonder and memories of the many things we got right and the many things we didn’t, or perhaps never will.
        
        
        
        
        This is the month in which, for many of us, the daily inner-workings of the home multiply into every corner possible: more groceries to buy (can you bring those walnuts again?), more lists to make (move card table to basement), more reminders to set (don’t forget to pick up uncle adam from airport), more questions to answer (henry’s a size 4 in pjs – thank you for thinking of him!). There are messes to clean and projects to manage and the little ones are tugging at your pants in need of scissors to wrap their sweet, beloved (messy/oversized/sticky/oddly-shaped and completely impractical) sculpture concocted out of of Elmer’s and cotton balls. Did I mention the messes to clean?
        
        The labor, of course, is largely invisible. Stockings stuffed in the dim of the dark, gifts wrapped long into the night. Notes sent, neighbors thanked, workers tipped, kids excited, house decorated, families welcomed, fridge filled, recipes found, menus planned, seating moved, music played, candles lit, stories read, traditions kept.
        
        Year after year, like magic.
        
        
        
        Until one day.
        
        In just a few short years, our frenzy and frantic will vanish right up the chimney and we’ll be left with a few drifting hours. Our hands won’t be as full, our table won’t be as crowded, our stockings will hang limp, and we’ll give anything to sweep up the crazed pine needle mess, to wash icing out of her hair once more, to hide gold coins in his sneakers tonight.
        
        We know we’d do it all over again and again, a million times over. The hustle, the bustle (yes, even the glitter). Someday, far sooner than we’d like, we’ll finally catch our breath and we’ll wonder: Did any of it mean anything – to anyone? 
        
        
        
        Will they remember? We can’t yet know.
        
        The whispered work, the invisible labor, the limited resources – the faith that it will all be worth it in the end. Every sleepless thought: could we have done more, should we have stressed less, would it have meant more? Perhaps it’s these secret wonderings that make this season more sacred, more human, more divine.
        
        While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love…
        
        After all, if there’s anything Christmas reminds us, it’s this: our king-sized expectations can, and must, fit into a lowly manger.
        
        
        
        I am thinking of this tonight, as I wrap a Slinky in butcher paper, as I tie it carefully with a quiet burlap bow, knowing it will soon be ripped to shreds, paper discarded, ribbon saved for one of Bee’s monumental craft projects come Jan 1.
        
        The wrapping, the containing, the concealing.
        The waiting, like a swaddled secret.
        
        The hopes and fears of all the years
        Are met in thee tonight.
        
        
        
        This morning, I read a few simple words in Luke. Just one line. Just a small part of a bigger birth story, a simple pause that follows a long and grueling labor of love and light, of hope and humanity: “Mary kept all these things to herself, holding them dear, deep within herself.”
        
        Keeping all these things. Holding them dear. Deep within ourselves.
        
        That’s the trick, isn’t it? The remembering.
        
        Even if no one else does. Even with fuller-than-full to-do lists. Even amidst limp stockings, empty chairs, grieving hearts. Even when the budget doesn’t allow for merriment, when family tensions are running high, when this year just isn’t what you wanted – or needed – it to be.
        
        Holding it dear.
        
        
        
        Counting every year, carrying every memory, tucking them all inside – to keep, and to keep close.
        
        To remember delight, at 10, when you shrieked at the red Schwinn under your Fraser fir. To remember love, at 20, when he held the mistletoe over your front door. To remember joy, at 30, as your bleary-eyed toddler twirls to the Nutcracker suite in his Batman pajamas. To remember hope, at 40, when the whole congregation swells into the song of Cantique de Noël. To know peace, at 50, 60, 99 – when you remember it all.
        
        For every decade, and every decade next, to be reminded of the glorious truth: When we give much away, we keep far, far more.
        
        Merry Decembers to you, friends.
        
        xoxo,

    title: "3 Good-for-Me Habits, and Another One",
    body: `First, something: I’m wary of assigning sanctimonious yarns to everyday behaviors. In truth, what makes for a good habit today doesn’t always carry the years.

        Related – For months, in college, I subsisted solely on free dinner rolls from the restaurant I waitressed at in a valiant attempt to save enough money for my first car. I’d have called that a good habit at the time. Look at that! I’d think. Just swimming in self control! Budget or bust!
        
        But for today, for the me that is alive and well, there are 3 decidedly good habits I’ve been establishing as of late, things worth falling into that have surprised even me. Three habits I am loving, habits that are shaping this small self beyond the me I once was. Here they are:
        
        
        
        
        FILLING THE STOCK POT WITH BANANA PEELS
        We’ve been composting for three years going strong, which I’ll admit is far less than I’d like it to be. Our gardening efforts are often hit-or-miss, and this year, we skipped the whole practice in the name of procrastination. There’s nary a tomato to be found, and yes, for the curious, I have indeed learned my lesson.
        
        And so, we’re doubling down on our efforts in preparation for a more – ahem – proactive spring next year. The dirt will be ready, no excuses allowed. All accountability aside, there’s something lovely about composting whether in need of soil or not. The act of filling a stock pot with banana peels, coffee grounds, egg shells, all manner of clementine peels dumped from small, sticky fingers. The end-of-night ritual of transferring the contents into the compost bin outdoors. Hearing the cicadas. Washing the pot. Awaiting a new cycle in the morning.
        
        As is expected, the newfound care has trickled into other areas: bringing my own mug to the coffee shop. Packing glass storage dishes to take home leftovers from our favorite diner. Saying “No, thanks,” to straws.
        
        Small things, indeed. But I happen to believe small things are not at all small.
        
        
        
        PANCAKES AT THE PLAYGROUND
        Last spring, I read the memoir that finally – once and for all – shook my indoor-loving self to the core. Ever since, the kids and I have shirked our former transportation methods in the comings and goings of our day in favor of one (two): feet. Dragging wagons of books to the library, jumping rope to the park, playing “Red Light, Green Light” all the way to the neighborhood playground and back.
        
        The walking – so much walking! – has sparked a hundred possibilities for exploration, and just this summer, I’ve finally stumbled upon a wooded path that leads straight to the grocery, coffee shop, and our favorite family diner.
        
        For those keeping score, where else is there to go?
        
        Our newfound walking habit is simple in the gilded breezes of summer, but truth be told: I’m hoping it sticks even after the weather turns. When the snow comes, of course, I think I can safely guarantee the momentum of at least one happy outing (bribe?): A mile-long stroll to the library for a book to read over hashbrowns, eggs, and sausage at our favorite diner. Pancakes to go, please, we say, and once the bill is paid, we stuff our tupperware under the stroller and head home – but not before a stop at the playground for monkey bars, catch, and three fistfuls of syrupy dessert on the lawn.
        
        We arrive home tired and sticky, easily having whittled 3-4 hours away, the better portion spent in the sun. It’s a tradition we’ve kept week after week, one worth continuing long after mittens are in order.
        
        
        
        IGNORING THE BARRETTES
        I haven’t sorted out the whys yet, but this is the first summer I’ve opted out of trends entirely. You’re not surprised, I know, nor are you a stranger to the slow layer-peel of releasing myself from the grips of consumerism, and yet: in the past, there have been many times I still wanted in. Many times it was difficult to resist the fiddle-leaf fig tree that I was sure would just make that corner in the dining room sing.
        
        It is no longer difficult.
        
        The woman who – a short lifetime ago – might have strolled the aisles of Target for fun has flown the coop. In fact, I realized in writing this that my last visit to Target was in 2016 to buy a car seat so we could bring Scout home. It stands to reason: what you look for, you’ll find.
        
        And what you don’t, you don’t.
        
        As such, I have completely missed the resurgence of barrettes, clips, etc. in all their nostalgic glory, and while I love and treasure the 90’s – and am forever complicating my relationship to hair – for now, for today, I’m ignoring the barrettes. Among other things.
        
        I will say one thing here: this habit surprisingly required a bit of soul-shifting. Having once been trusted as someone who knew what was just on the cusp, taking a few steps back has presented a small bruising in pride.
        
        (Well worth it, I have noticed.)
        
        —
        
        The last habit? One that I can’t accurately categorize as bad, but simply a ritual I’ve had a rough go of shaking:
        
        
        
        MAKING 4-INGREDIENT PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES WITH 5 MINUTES AND A FREEZER
        I affectionately refer to these as peaNOT butter cookies, because expectations are important. Still, if you find yourself with a midnight hankering for the oven version, this will help:
        
        Mix 1 cup of almond flour with a drizzle or two of honey and 1/2 cup of peanut butter. Shape into balls. If you’re feeling fancy, lay them out on parchment paper and press each ball down with a fork to make those beloved crosshatches. Sprinkle with sea salt and throw ’em in the freezer for a few minutes. Thaw, then bliss.
        
         
        
        Tell me: any new habits you’re trying on lately? You know how much I love to hear all about ’em.`,
